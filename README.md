NFL Pre-snap Play Prediction - NFL Big Data Bowl 2025
Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict offensive play types in NFL games using player tracking and game situation data. This project focuses on pre-snap prediction to understand offensive strategies and help defenses prepare for upcoming plays.
Technical Implementation
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Processed NFL tracking data containing player positions and game situations
Created specialized features including:

Formation type analysis
Player positioning metrics
Game situation variables (down, distance, score differential)
Team-specific historical tendencies


Implemented comprehensive null value handling and data cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzed play type distributions across different game situations
Investigated correlations between formation types and play calls
Visualized player positioning patterns using seaborn and matplotlib
Created statistical summaries of play-calling tendencies

Machine Learning Pipeline

Implemented XGBoost classifier for play prediction
Utilized K-fold cross-validation for model validation
Applied feature importance analysis to identify key predictive factors
Optimized model hyperparameters for improved performance
